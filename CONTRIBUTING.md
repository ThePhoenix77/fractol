This document outlines how you can contribute to the fractol project. I appreciate your interest and willingness to help!

## Getting Started
Before diving into contributions, it's helpful to understand the project workflow:

  *  Fork the repository: Create your own copy of the fractol repository on GitHub. This allows you to make changes without affecting the original codebase.
  *  Clone your fork: Download your forked repository to your local machine using git clone.
  *  Create a branch: For your specific changes, create a new branch using git checkout -b <branch_name>. (Replace <branch_name> with a descriptive name for your branch).
  *  Make your changes: Edit the code in your local copy and implement your desired features or bug fixes.
  *  Commit your changes: Use git add to stage your changes and git commit -m "<commit message>" to create a commit with a clear description of your modifications.
  *  Push your changes: Upload your local branch to your forked repository on GitHub using git push origin <branch_name>.
  *  Making a Pull Request
    
Once you're happy with your changes, it's time to share them with the main project. Here's how:

 * Open a Pull Request: On your GitHub repository, navigate to the "Pull Requests" tab and click "New pull request."
 * Compare branches: Select your branch with the changes from the "Head" branch dropdown menu. Leave the "Base" branch as "master" (or the main branch of the project).
 * Review changes: GitHub will display a comparison between your branch and the main project.
 * Write a clear description: Provide a concise summary of your contribution and the purpose of your changes. Highlight any functionalities you added, bugs you fixed, or improvements you made.
 * Submit your Pull Request: Once you're confident in your description, click "Create pull request."

## Code Style and Conventions
I encourage contributors to maintain consistent code style and formatting for better readability and maintainability. While specific guidelines aren't mandated, following common C coding conventions is recommended.

### Testing Your Changes
Before submitting a pull request, ensure your changes don't introduce any regressions. I recommend testing your code thoroughly to verify it functions as intended.

### Communication and Feedback
I'm committed to creating a welcoming and collaborative environment. Feel free to discuss your ideas or ask questions before or during your contribution process. You can open an issue on GitHub or reach out to me for communication.

### What I Look For in Contributions
I appreciate contributions that:

 * Improve functionality: Introduce new features, enhance existing functionalities, or optimize performance.
 * Fix bugs: Address reported bugs or identify and fix potential issues in the code.
 * Enhance code quality: Refactor existing code for better readability or maintainability.
 * Improve documentation: Update existing documentation or add new documentation for improved user understanding.

I reserve the right to review and potentially reject contributions that don't align with the project's goals or introduce technical issues.

### Thank You!
I appreciate your willingness to contribute to the fractol project. Your efforts will help me create a more robust and valuable tool for exploring the fascinating world of fractals.
